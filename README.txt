Matlab and Simulinlk FILES execution (MOTION AND TRAJECTORY PLANNING developed by Francesco Grasso)

(function "drawnow" in draw.m is commented)
(If A_star.m  returns errors or "solution not found!" the path is not found)

1) Motion_Planning_Final.m  for a generic path
2) multi_waypts.m for a path through multiple waypoints
3) trajectory.m for trajectory planning


------------------------------------------------------
Matlab and Simulinlk FILES execution (CONTROLLERS developed by Antonio Rescigno)
1) main.m
2) choose the control to adopt from the menu (1 for PID 2 for passivity-based-control)
3) execute the chosen control scheme on simulink
